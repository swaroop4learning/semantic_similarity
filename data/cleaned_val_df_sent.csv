as an complement to the other answers let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking,the other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense,0.4
stars are rotating but thats not the cause for their stability,stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from,3.0
it indeed appears the andromeda galaxy mnum and the milky way mw are en route to a collision,in a few billion years the milky way and andromeda will collide,4.4
the short answer is we are made from the stuff contributed by many stars,it is highly unlikely that were made out of stuff from only one star,3.2
